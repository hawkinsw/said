# C++ Filt

`c++filt` is an amazing tool for those digging in to the details of a piece of malware written in C++. It is even great for those perusing the details of malware that, although *not* written in C++, uses a C++ library.

`c++filt` takes the *mangled* names of a C++ function and decodes it into something that looks like what the C++ programmer wrote when they declared it.

# Mangos are fruits and not programming things

Just what does it mean for a name to be *mangled*? Well, I will defer to the authors of the `c++filt` `man` page for the definition:

> The C++ ... language[] provide[s] function overloading, which means
that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that
each function takes parameters of different types.  In order to be able
to distinguish these similarly named functions C++ ... encode[s] them
into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each
different version.  This process is known as mangling.

In other words, mangling a name is a way of building unique identifiers for each of the different instances of an overloaded function. After all, in C++

```C++
void function(int a, int b) {
  ...
}

void function(double a, double b) {
  ...
}
```

is legal. If a linker looked at the name of the function alone (`function`) it would have no idea which one to invoke because they have the same name. What differentiates the two are their parameter types. So, the mangled name of this function includes type information so that each name is unique -- how cool!

>Note: The names of types in C++ can also be mangled. `c++filt` will also demangle those names, but will require addition CLI options. The tool's `man` page describes these additional options.

## Terminal

`c++filt` is a command-line utility. Before continuing, make sure that you have access to a terminal emulator.

## Newfangled or demangled?

Mangled names are notoriously hard to read. That said, you *can* demangle a name yourself. All you would need is to completely understand the [C++ ABI](http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/). But who would want to learn all that cool information if there were an elegant tool that already does it? Enter `c++filt`!

The awesome thing about `c++filt` is just how easy it is to use -- the only parameter it takes is the mangled name!

```console
$ c++filt _Z8functionii
function(int, int)
$ c++filt _Z8functiondd
function(double, double)
```

## Say As I Do

Given the mangled name `_Z5crazydc`, determine ...

1. The name of the function;
2. The number of parameter(s);
3. The type of the parameter(s); and
4. The type of the return value.
